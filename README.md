# AppLifecycleCallbacks
Callbacks for when your app comes to foreground and goes to background. 

We make you of [ProcessLifecycleOwner](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/ProcessLifecycleOwner) to get these callbacks. A detailed blog explaining its implementation and use cases is available on [Faanghut](https://faanghut.com). Kindly check out [this](https://faanghut.com/app-lifecycle-callbacks-going-to-foreground-background/) article and let us know if you face any issues while implementing it.
